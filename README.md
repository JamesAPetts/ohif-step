# Overview

[STEP](https://github.com/pieper/step) is a work in progress medical image computing project by [`pieper`](), documented therein.

> The goal is to implement GPU accelerated volume calculations using
JavaScript and WebGL 2.0.  Everything should run in the browser
with only data access coming from external servers.

> Internal data structures should be as close as possible
to native DICOM representations.

This is a small wrapper around some functionality of the original implementation, which we want to build into an npm package.
